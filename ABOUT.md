# Zen - The AI

## Unified AI presence across all your devices:
- **Smartphone**
- **Laptop/desktop**
- **Alexa/smart speakers**
- **Potentially other smart home devices**
- **Shared knowledge base** - the AI has the same information regardless of which device you're using
- **Persistent memory** with both short-term and long-term information storage

## Developer-Focused Tool System
- **Programmable tools** that developers can create and integrate
- **Custom syntax** for invoking tools (like a command language)
- **Script execution** - tools can trigger Python files, shell scripts, etc.
- **Hardware control** - examples like turning LEDs on/off, but could control any connected device

## Why It's Better Than ChatGPT (for developers)
- Not about having the smartest AI model, but about having the most extensible and controllable system
- Custom tool integration means unlimited possibilities for automation
- Developer control over what the AI can do and how it behaves
- Home automation focus rather than general chat

## Example Use Cases
- **Voice command**: "Turn off all the lights" → AI parses command → Executes Python script → Controls smart LEDs
- **Cross-device continuity**: Start a task on your phone, continue on laptop, finish via Alexa
- **Custom workflows**: "Start work mode" → Dims lights, opens specific apps, adjusts temperature, etc.
- **Development assistance**: AI can run tests, deploy code, monitor systems - all through custom tools

## The Vision
Essentially, you're creating a smart home operating system for developers - where the AI is the interface, but the real power comes from the tools and automations that developers can build and integrate into their living/working space.
